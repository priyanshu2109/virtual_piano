# virtual_piano
This project main goal is that everyone in this world who is unable to buy his/her piano but want to play it,it's for them.
I have download notes for each key from the internet and then assigned it using JavaScript.
This project also has a player which will help you for ear training and i also wanted to include some exercises too, but couldn't.
I will add exercises in the near future.
